# Week 29/30 

It's unclear how much spare time we'll have this coming fortnight, but what time we have is going to be spent on the UI adding user facing controls to the system.

Once that's completed, a mechanism by which the user token can be used to instantiate a new dispatcher 



## performance

* Node U (exp 29-30) - Didn't do initial exploration - why?
  * The evolution behaviour appears to be buying goods when it's at the end of the chain and there's no profitable location - so it ends up selling them at a loss next time around.
  
* Node C (27-28) - Didn't do initial exploration - why?
  * It actually did in the end!
  * But jump gate building wasn't on by default - it should be.
* Node V (26-27) - Didn't do initial exploration - why?
