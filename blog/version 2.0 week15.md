I'm working on visualiser tools to help interact with the conductor and dispatcher without the need to do database stuff.
Ideally this would be a web interface, so I could interact with it from my phone, but that would require switching languages to use JavaScript and its frameworks for rendering.

In fact... why not? It's going to be a useful skillset to have.
